Each rover carries a sophisticated set of instruments to search for evidence of liquid water that may have been present in the planet's past. The rovers are identical to each other, but are exploring different regions of Mars. </td>

<p class="lead span12">Twice as long and three times as heavy as the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity will collect martian soil samples and rocks and analyze them for organic compounds and environmental conditions that could have supported microbial life now or in the past. </p>
